# Basic Music Recommender

This is my first attempt at creating a simple music recommendation system using primarily Euclidean-distance based techniques.  In the Python notebook, you'll find a walkthrough of the entire process. Clone the repo, add some data to the 'data' folder, and run through the notebook to get some music recommendations from your dataset based on your input song! 

Enjoy. Bug fixes/improvements to come soon.
